## Documentation Guidelines
- **Do NOT create .md documentation files** unless explicitly requested by the user
- Focus on code implementation rather than documentation
- Keep comments in code concise and functional
- Only create README updates if specifically asked

## Database Guidelines  
- **Do NOT create database migrations** unless explicitly requested
- The project is fine with losing data during development
- Make direct changes to db_models.py when updating schemas
- Only create migration scripts when specifically asked for production deployment

## Code Preferences
- Prioritize working code over comprehensive documentation
- Use inline comments for complex logic but avoid over-documenting
- Focus on implementation first, documentation second
- Keep responses concise and action-focused

## File Creation Rules
- Avoid creating auxiliary files unless necessary for functionality
- Don't create example/test files unless requested
- Focus on modifying existing files rather than creating new ones
- Only create new files when they're essential for the requested feature

## General Approach

- Prioritize the user's immediate needs over comprehensive solutions
- Keep the codebase lean and focused
